  Quick Installation (recommended):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/install.sh | bash
  ```
  For detailed setup instructions, including firewall configuration and prerequisites, see the [Quick Installation Guide](#1-quick-installation-recommended) below.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

### Server Requirements
You need a server with SSH access. This can be:
- A VPS
- A Dedicated Server
- A VM in Proxmox
- A Raspberry Pi (for all compatible models read the [Raspberry Pi OS Setup Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/how-to/raspberry-pi-os#prerequisites) prerequisites)
- Any other server with SSH access

<Aside>
  It is strongly recommended to use a fresh, newly created server for installing Hostly. Installing on an existing server with other applications may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  If you don't have a server or server provider yet, we prefer to use Hetzner.

  You can use our [referral link](https://hostly.khulnasoft.com/hetzner). It will help us to keep the project alive.
</Aside>


### Supported Operating Systems

- Debian based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Redhat based Linux distributions (CentOS, Fedora, Redhat, AlmaLinux, Rocky, Asahi, etc.)
- SUSE based Linux distributions (SLES, SUSE, openSUSE, etc.)
- Arch Linux
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Raspbian)
- Alpine Linux


### Supported Architectures
We only support 64-bit architectures:
- AMD64
- ARM64

<Aside type="caution">
For Raspberry Pi users: You must use the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian). See our [Raspberry Pi OS Setup Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/how-to/raspberry-pi-os) for instructions.
</Aside>

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

#### Server Requirements for Hostly
- 2 Core CPU
- 2 GBs memory (RAM)
- 30+ GB of storage for the images

If you build and host on the same server as Hostly and your builds are utilizing all available memory, this may cause the server to become unresponsive or even crash.
To prevent this, consider enabling swap space on your server (or paying for more resources).

#### Server Requirements for Your Resources
Choosing your server resources depends on your usage. If you are planning to run a lot of things, you should consider buying a server with more resources.

Hosting `Supabase`, `Appwrite` or `Posthog` requires more resources than hosting a static site (waay more).

<Aside type="tip">

Here is an example. I'm hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:

```
- 8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)
- 4 CPUs (average usage ~20-30%)
- 150GB disk (usage 40GB)
```

For the following things:

```
- 3 NodeJS apps
- 4 Static sites
- Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)
- Fider (feedback tool)
- UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)
- Ghost (my newsletters)
- 3 Redis databases
- 2 PostgreSQL databases
```

</Aside>


## Installation Methods

### 1. Quick Installation (Recommended)

<Steps>
1. Prepare Your Server
   - Log in as the `root` user (non-root user is not fully supported yet [non-root-user](/docs/knowledge-base/server/non-root-user))
   - Configure SSH by following the [SSH Settings Configuration Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/server/openssh#ssh-settings-configuration)
   - Configure required firewall ports using the [Firewall Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall) (if you are an advanced user you can have this configured differently)
   - Ensure `curl` is installed (pre-installed on most systems)

2. Run the Installation Script

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/install.sh | bash
   ```
   > View the [Scripts Source Code](https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly/blob/main/scripts/install.sh)

    <Aside type="note">
    If you are not running the script as the `root` user, switch to the `root` user or use the script with `sudo`:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```
    </Aside>

3. Access Hostly
   - You can find the URL of your hostly instance in the installation output.
   - It is recommended to use the PrivateIP to access hostly as it is more secure (a VPN setup to your Server is needed for that to work).

    <Aside type="note">
      If you installed hostly on a Raspberry Pi which is in your home network you can use the private IP address to  access hostly as the public IP address will not work.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

**The installer does the following:**
- Installs required tools (`curl wget git jq openssl`)
- Installs Docker Engine (27)

<Aside type="caution">
Docker engine installed via snap is not supported!
</Aside>

- Configures Docker logging
- Configures Docker daemon with default address pools
- Creates directory structure at `/data/hostly`
- Sets up SSH keys for server management
- Installs and starts Hostly

### 2. Manual Installation
For users who prefer more control over the installation process.

<Steps>
1. SSH Enabled
    Make sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: [more details here](/docs/knowledge-base/server/openssh).

2. Curl Installed
    Make sure `curl` command is available on your server.

3. Install Docker Engine (24+)
    Follow the official documentation to install Docker Engine on your server: [Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server).

    <Aside type="caution">
    Make sure to not install docker engine via snap as this is not supported!
    </Aside>

4. Create Directories
    Create the base configuration directories under `/data/hostly`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /data/hostly/{source,ssh,applications,databases,backups,services,proxy,webhooks-during-maintenance}
    mkdir -p /data/hostly/ssh/{keys,mux}
    mkdir -p /data/hostly/proxy/dynamic
    ```

5. Generate SSH Key
    Generate an SSH key for Hostly to be able to manage this server from itself.

    ```bash

    ssh-keygen -f /data/hostly/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal -t ed25519 -N '' -C root@hostly
    ```

6. Setup Your SSH Key
    Add your public SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This will allow Hostly to connect to this server from itself.

    ```bash
    cat /data/hostly/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    <Aside type="tip">
    You can skip this step if you already have an SSH key. But you need to add this key to your Hostly instance after installation.
    </Aside>

7. Setup Configuration Files
    Copy the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `.env.production` & `upgrade.sh` files from Hostly's CDN to `/data/hostly/source`.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/docker-compose.yml -o /data/hostly/source/docker-compose.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/docker-compose.prod.yml -o /data/hostly/source/docker-compose.prod.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/.env.production -o /data/hostly/source/.env
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/upgrade.sh -o /data/hostly/source/upgrade.sh
    ```

8. Set Permissions
   Set permissions for all the files and directories.
    ```bash
    chown -R 9999:root /data/hostly
    chmod -R 700 /data/hostly
    ```

9. Generate Values
    Generate values for the following variables in `/data/hostly/source/.env`.
    ```bash
    sed -i "s|APP_ID=.*|APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 16)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|APP_KEY=.*|APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|DB_PASSWORD=.*|DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|REDIS_PASSWORD=.*|REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_ID=.*|PUSHER_APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_KEY=.*|PUSHER_APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=.*|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/hostly/source/.env
    ```
    <Aside type="caution">
    This only needs to be done once, when you install Hostly for the first time. If you do it after Hostly has been first started, it will break your installation.

    Make sure you save the values somewhere that are stored in the `.env` file. If you lose them, you will lose access to your Hostly installation and all your data.
    </Aside>

10. Default Docker Network
    Make sure the default `hostly` Docker network is available.
    ```bash
    docker network create --attachable hostly
    ```

11. Start Hostly
    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file /data/hostly/source/.env -f /data/hostly/source/docker-compose.yml -f /data/hostly/source/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --pull always --remove-orphans --force-recreate
    ```

12. Open Hostly's UI
    Now you can access Hostly on port `http://<ip>:8000` of your server.

</Steps>

### 3. Docker Desktop Installation
For local development and testing purposes only.

<Aside type="caution">
  This is not recommended for production usage. This is only for testing
  purposes.
</Aside>

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows.
- Create a directory that will hold all your Hostly related data. For example in your User directory: `C:\Users\yourusername\hostly`.
- Copy `docker-compose.windows.yml` and `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to the directory you created in the previous step.
- Rename `docker-compose.windows.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Rename `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to `.env`.
- Create a `hostly` docker network with `docker network create hostly`.
- Optional: Change the values in `.env` file.
- Start Hostly with `docker compose up` command.
- You can access Hostly on port `localhost:8000` of your machine.


<Aside type="caution">
Hostly Proxy is still not working on Windows.
</Aside>


## Debugging

### Expired GitHub Personal Access Token
You might encounter one of these errors:

```bash
Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/khulnasoft/hostly-helper/manifests/1.0.1": unauthorized: authentication required
```

or

```bash
Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/khulnasoft/hostly-helper:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/khulnasoft/hostly-helper/manifests/latest": denied: denied
```

These errors indicate that Docker cannot authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). To resolve this, you can either:

1. Log out of the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):
```bash
docker logout ghcr.io
```

2. Or renew your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) if you need to maintain authenticated access for deployments for example.

### Raspberry Pi Crashes
If you are using a Raspberry Pi with only 2GB of RAM, you may experience system crashes even with swap space enabled. This probably occurs because Raspberry PIs often use SD cards which are slower than SSDs and can be unstable.

The solution is to either:
- Upgrade to a modern Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ of RAM, or
- Limit Docker's memory usage by adding the following to your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "memory": "1.8g"
}
```

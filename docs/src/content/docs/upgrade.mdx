There are several ways to upgrade your Hostly instance.

1. **Automatic Upgrade**: Hostly will automatically check for updates and upgrade your instance when a new version is available. [Learn more about automatic updates](/docs/knowledge-base/hostly-updates#update-settings).

<Aside type="tip">You can disable the auto-update feature in the `Settings` menu.</Aside>

2. **Semi-Automatic Upgrade**: If there is a new version available, you can upgrade your Hostly instance by clicking the `Upgrade` button on the Navigation bar. Update checks can be configured in the [settings menu](/docs/knowledge-base/hostly-updates#update-settings).

3. **Manual Upgrade**: If you want to upgrade your Hostly instance manually, you can do so executing the following command in your server's terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.khulnasoft.com/hostly/install.sh | bash
```
